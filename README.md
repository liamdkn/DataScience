### Volunteer Work

Throughout my three years studying software development I have acquired many skills in building websites. I decided to put them to use and volunteer to help with my local hurling clubâ€™s website for my village.<br> 
- The website is powered by clubforce which is an all-in-one platform that hosts the website and allows us to host a weekly lottery. The funds generated from this lottery are vital for the day-to-day operations of the hurling club offering locals a simple way to raise funds. 
- The website acts as a digital bulletin for all news relating to the hurling club. It delivers club notices, details on events, fixtures and results, and other club announcements. My main role with the website is on the bulletin when a match report comes in from the club. <br><br>

My experience in helping manage the hurling club website has shown me the impact that technology can have on a community and is an achievement that I am proud to be a part of in my village.<br><br>

## Data Science & Machine Learning Projects
### Project 1: Housing Sales vs Population & Income in Irelnad

#### Project Description
In this project, I utilise data collected from the [Property Services Regulatory Authority](https://propertypriceregister.ie) and the [Central Statistics Office](https://data.cso.ie). Using this data I will analyse how income and population data has impacted the price of residental housing sales. 

#### Project Goals
- Analyse & visualise historical housing sales.
    - Explore data on housing sales to gain insight into trends or patterns.
    - Create a narative of historical data, do prices only increase, or do they fluctuate? 
- Analyse the correlation between housing sales and population per county.
    - Investigate historical using statstical methods and data visualization to locate correlation/paterns.
- Analyse the correlation between housing sales and income per county. 
    - Investigate historical using statstical methods and data visualization  to locate any trends or patterns
    - Using this data, predict how income levels in the future can influence house sale prices. 
- Build a machine learning model to predict how future income and population will affect housing prices. 
    - Using trends are patterns found, make preditictions for each county in Ireland to see how future population and Income levels will affect housing prices. 


#### Data Sets
- The first, and largest data set I am using is 'Property Price Register Ireland'. <br>
The raw file contains 476745 rows and 9 columns. Data included is the: 


    - Sale Date (2010 - 2021)
    - County
    - Sale Price
    - If Market Price
    - If Vat Excluded: 2nd hand houses do not include VAT on sale price. 
    - Property Description
    - Property Size
- Cleaning the data set included:
    - Dropping unrequired columns: Address, Postal Code, If Market Price, Property Size Desc
    - Dropping rows with null value: 0 rows were dropped 
    - Renaming columns: SALE_DATE:YEAR, SALE_PRICE:SALE PRICE,IF_VAT_EXCLUDED:VAT EXCLUDED, PROPERTY_DESC: NEW BUILD
    - Adding VAT to sale prices if it was excluded: This is to ensure that all prices are on the same baseline. 
    - Changing string values for new/old house to 1/0
- After cleaning the data there are 476,745 rows & 4 columns (Sale Date, County, Sale Price, Property Description)
2. The second data set I am using is population data from the Central Statistics Office. The raw file contains 2232 rows and 7 columns. Data included is: 
    - Census Year (2011 - 2022)
    - County and City
    - Marital Status
    - Sex
    - Population value
- Cleaning the dataset included:
    - Dropping columns
    - Dropping rows with null value
    - Removing rows that were just male or female data.
    - Removing rows that were total data for Ireland (not by county)
    - Cleaning and standardising county names. 
    - Grouping rows where year and county matches, summing the population in the process. 
- After cleaning the data there are 78 rows & 3 columns (Census Year, County, Population Value)
3. The third data set that I am using is household income data per county from the Central Statistics Office. The raw file contains 1944 rows & 6 columns. Data included is:
    - Year (2011 - 2022)
    - County 
    - Sex
    - Mean annual Income
    - Median annual Income 
-Cleaning the dataset included: 
    - Dropping columns
    - Dropping rows with null value
    - Removing male/female rows, only keeping sum of both sexes. 
    - Removing 'All counties' sumed values. 
- After cleaning the dataset there are 624 rows & 4 columns (Statistic Label, Year, County, Value)

## Processing Datasets

### Data Set 1: Property Price Register Ireland <br>
#### Descriptive Statistics
- The Plots below are a representation of 26 counties in the Republic of Ireland. <br

##### Step 1: Calculate the mean sales price for each county.  
![Mean Sale Prices Over Time by County](Images/meanPropertyPrice.png "Mean Sale Prices Over Time by County Plot")
- This lineplot represents the average sale price on housing from 2010 - 2021
- Note the depreciation in value from 2010 - 2012, this was a lagging result of
the recession in Ireland.
<br><br>

##### Step 2: Calculate the mode sales price for each county. 
![Mode Sale Prices Over Time by County](Images/modePropertyPrice.png "Mode Sale Prices Over Time by County Plot")

- This is the most frequent occurring sale price for each year. In this case, the data has been grouped by its county and year. The X-Axis is the year from 2010 - 2021 and the Y-Axis is the sale price in euros. The mode is used to identify a baseline, and can be used to identify outliars.<br>
 - Note that this graph is much less consistant compared to the mean graph above. 

##### Step 3: Calculate the median sales price for each county. 
![Median Sale Prices Over Time by County](Images/medianPropertyPrice.png "Median Sale Prices Over Time by County Plot")

- This is the middle most value in the data set, 50% of the data in this graph are below the point and 50% is above. This gives a representation of the middle selling prices of a house from 2010 - 2021. 

#### Annual Growth Rate
The annual growth rate shows the percentage change in housing prices. I am going to mean and median of the sales prices to gain insights on the growth rate. 

##### Overall Growth Rate
##### Step 1: Calculate the Annual Growth Rate using the mean & median. 

![Overall Annual Growth Rate: Mean & Median](Images/overallAnnualProperty.png "Overall Annual Growth Rate: Mean & Median")

##### Growth Rate By County 
##### Step 1: Calculate the Growth Rate using the mean

![Annual Growth Rate per County: Mean](Images/meanAnnualProperty_County.png "Annual Growth Rate per County: Mean")

##### Step 2: Calculate the Growth Rate using the median

![Annual Growth Rate per County: Median](Images/medianAnnualProperty_County.png "Annual Growth Rate per County: Median")

### Data Set 2: Ireland's Census Population 
The census is an offical survey in Ireland carried out every four years, it gathers details including population. This data set is the count of individuals in each county. 
<br>

#### Descriptive Statistics 
Typical central tendency measures such as mean, mode and median are not that accurate at representing population data. Total counts or porportions are more relevant for this data. 

##### Step 1: Represent the population sum of each county. 
![Census Population by County](Images/censusPopulation_bar.png "Census Population by County Plot")

This bar plot represents the popuation in millions for each county, there are three bars per country that show data from the 2011, 2016,& 2022 census. 

##### Step 2: Represent the proportion of individuals in each county from 2011 - 2022
![Proportion of Population in each County (2011 - 2022)](Images/censusPopulation_pie.png "Proportion of Population in each County (2011 - 2022)")

This pie chart shows the percentages of people that live in each county, with Dublin having the highest at 28.1% followeed by Cork at 11.4% and Galway at 5.4%


#### Annual Growth Rate:

![Population Growth Rate (2011 - 2022)](Images/populationGrowth_County.png "Population Growth Rate (2011 - 2022)")


#### Regional Comparisons

### Dataset 3: Annual Household income

#### Descriptive Statistics:

##### Step 1: Calculate the overall annual earnings using the mean & median

![Mean and Median Yearly Earnings](Images/overallMedianEarnings.png "Mean and Median Yearly Earnings")



##### Step 3: Calculate annual earnings by county using the mean 

![Mean Yearly Earnings by County](Images/meanAnnualEarnings_County.png "Mean Yearly Earnings by County")

##### Step 4: Calculate annual earnings by county using the median

![Median Yearly Earnings by County](Images/medianAnnualEarnings_County.png "Median Yearly Earnings by County")


#### Annual Growth Rate:

##### Step 1: Calculate the annual growth per county rate using the mean

![Mean Annual Earnings Growth Rate by County](Images/meanAnnualIncome_County.png "Mean Annual Earnings Growth Rate by County")

##### Step 2: Calculate the annual growth per county rate using the median

![Median Annual Earnings Growth Rate by County](Images/medianAnnualIncome_County.png "Median Annual Earnings Growth Rate by County")
