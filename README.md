## How to complie and run the project
Prerequisites: [How to install](#to-install-this-project)
1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the repositorys directory.
2. To complie and create an executable for helloThreads & mutualEx type make in the terminal. 
3. To compile and create an executable for helloThreads type make helloThreads in the terminal
4. To compile and create an executable for mutualEx type make mutualEx in the terminal
5. To clean up .o files created by the project, type make CLEAN in the terminal.
