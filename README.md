# Data Science & Machine Learning Portfolio

## Course Code: CW228-4
**Semester 2 Continuous Assessment 1**

### Project Overview
This GitHub repository is a continuation from my previous repo that was corrupted. 

The objective is to expand and enhance our data science and machine learning portfolio by implementing Jupyter notebooks for various machine learning algorithms. 
My notebooks are significantly changed from the original, all containing new datasets.

### Project Structure
The project structure involves creating a Jupyter notebook for each covered machine learning algorithm. The current notebooks completed include:
1. **Naive-Bayes.ipynb**
 - Original Notebook: Text classification using `20 newsgroups`
 - Modified Notebook: Tet classification using `bbc-news-data-`
2. **Support Vector Machines.ipynb**
 - Original Notebook: Facial Recognition 
 - Modified Notebook: Butterfly Recognition 
3. **K Nearest Neighbour.ipynb**
 - Original Notebook: Prediciting age of sea slugs
 - Modified Notebook: Predicitng if email is spam or not
4. **K Means Clustering.ipynb**
 - Original Notebook: Digit classification & China image compression
 - Modified Notebook: Iris classification & Flower image compression
5. **FeedFoward Neural Nural Network**
 - Original Notebook: Handwritten Digit Classifier
 - Modified Notebook: Clothes Image Classifier 
6. **MultiLayer Perceptron Network**
 - Original Notebook: Handwritten Digit Classifier
 - Modified Notebook: Clothes Image Classifier 
7. **Convolutional Neural Network**
 - Original Notebook: Handwritten Digit Classifier
 - Modified Notebook: Clothes Image Classifier
